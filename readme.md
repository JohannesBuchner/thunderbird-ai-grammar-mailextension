# Thunderbird Langtool Mail Extension

This an (unofficial) [Language Tool](https://languagetool.org/) extension for [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/).
This extension makes it possible to query a Language tool server directly from Thunderbird.

The extension may be used with the public Langtool server [https://api.languagetoolplus.com/](https://api.languagetoolplus.com/).
If you prefer to keep your data locally, run a [local instance of the Langtool server](https://dev.languagetool.org/http-server) and change the Server URL to your localhost instance.

**Thunderbird MailExtension.** This extension is developed using _only_ the [Thunderbird MailExtension API](https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/index.html) (excluding the Experiments API). This is done to ensure compatibility with future versions of Thunderbird.


## Installation

First download the latest .xpi of the add-on [here](https://github.com/raulpardo/thunderbird-langtool-mailextension/releases/), then [install it in Thunderbird as usual](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird).


## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome and encouraged. As mentioned above, the only constraint is only using the [Thunderbird MailExtension API](https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/index.html) (excluding the Experiments API).
